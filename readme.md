This project is a streamlined hackathon judging platform that enables organizers to manage projects, judges, rooms, and schedules from a single interface. Instead of traditional numeric scores, judges allocate virtual investment funds to projects, providing a more intuitive signal of interest and quality, while administrators configure tracks, rooms, and calendar settings through a dedicated dashboard. The web app is built with Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Recharts.
